- Hello, my name is Theophile Sabangu Kapembi. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which I earned in 2010. I am currently pursuing my third certificate in Database Administration at BYU-Idaho. My educational journey has been diverse and enriching. In 2022, I graduated from Ensign College with a Technical Support Engineer certificate, and in 2024, I completed a System Administration certificate. Additionally, I earned a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in 2024.

Before attending Ensign College, I completed the Pathway certificate, where I developed essential skills in English, life, professional, and academic areas. I have honed my technical expertise in MySQL, SQL, Spreadsheets, R, Python, and Tableau. I am passionate about working with data, supporting users, and managing networks. Currently, I am the Database Manager at CADIMEK, a non-profit organization in the D.R. Congo. I am actively seeking new opportunities, both remote and on-site, where I can continue to leverage my skills and experience to make a positive impact.
